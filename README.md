# Database DevOps Project

Welcome to the Database DevOps Project for [Your Project Name]. This project aims to demonstrate best practices for managing database schema changes, data seeding, and database unit testing.

## Overview

In this project, we'll cover the following aspects of Database DevOps:

- Managing database schema changes using migration scripts.
- Populating the database with initial data using seeding scripts.
- Performing database unit testing to ensure the correctness of queries and database functionality.
- Automating the deployment and rollback of database changes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Your Database System] installed and running.
- [Any Additional Prerequisites, if applicable]

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Database DevOps project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/database-devops-project.git
   cd database-devops-project

## Additional Setup Instructions, if applicable.

- Database Migration

We manage database schema changes using migration scripts located in the db/migrations/ directory. Each script represents a specific version of the database schema. To apply migrations, use the deploy.sh script:

```shell

./scripts/deploy.sh
```
- Data Seeding

The seed_data.sql script in the db/seed/ directory is responsible for populating the database with initial data. To seed data, run:

```shell

mysql -h your_db_host -u your_db_user -p your_db_name < db/seed/seed_data.sql
```
- Database Unit Testing

We've included unit test scripts in the tests/db/ directory to ensure the correctness of database queries and functionality. To run tests, execute the appropriate scripts and review the results.

- Deployment and Rollback

Use the provided deploy.sh and rollback.sh scripts in the scripts/ directory to automate the deployment of schema changes and rollback in case of issues.
